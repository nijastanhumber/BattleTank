# Battle Tank
An open-world head-to-head tank fight with simple AI, terrain, and advanced constrol system in Unreal 4.

This is a tutorial series from Udemy's Unreal Engine course. The link is at [here](www.udemy.com/Unreal-Engine/Unreal-Engine). It teaches how to use UE4 using C++ mainly. Very helpful and I'd recommend it to anyone!
